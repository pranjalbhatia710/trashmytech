# 🚀 AGENT_SOP.md — Standard Operating Protocol for AI Agents
### Applies to: Antigravity IDE · Gemini CLI · Claude Code · Cursor · Codex CLI · OpenCode · AdaL CLI
### Version: 3.0.0 — FINAL | Maintainer: RapidXAI | February 2026
### Source Skills: Antigravity Awesome Skills (868+ skills) — github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills
---
> ⚠️ **ABSOLUTE MANDATE:** Every AI agent — regardless of tool, model, or task — MUST read and execute this SOP in full before writing a single line of code, generating a single component, or making any architectural decision. This document IS the operating system of every project. No exceptions. No shortcuts.
---
## 🧠 CORE PHILOSOPHY: THE TANDEM SKILL DOCTRINE
> Read this before everything else. This is the single most important concept in this document.
**A single skill is a single expert. Every real project needs a full team.**
You are NOT limited to invoking one skill at a time. Invoking a single skill for most tasks is negligence. You MUST evaluate every task, identify every discipline it touches, and invoke ALL relevant skills simultaneously or in a defined sequence.
### The Three Laws of Skill Invocation
**Law 1 — Never use one skill where two or more apply.**
If a task touches design AND code, invoke both `@ui-ux-pro-max` AND `@react-patterns`. If it touches code AND security, invoke both `@typescript-expert` AND `@api-security-best-practices`. Always.
**Law 2 — Skills within the same layer run in parallel. Skills across layers run in sequence.**
You can invoke `@frontend-design` + `@react-patterns` + `@tailwind-patterns` at the same time because they are all frontend skills operating on the same surface. But you run planning BEFORE building, and testing AFTER building.
**Law 3 — Declare your full skill stack before you touch anything.**
At the start of every session and every major task, output a skill stack declaration (see Phase 0). An undeclared skill is an unused skill.
### The Tandem Mental Model
Think of every project as a building with floors. Each floor needs its own specialist team, and no floor can be skipped:
```
PROJECT STACK — ALL FLOORS MUST BE STAFFED
├── Floor 6: Business     → @brainstorming + @concise-planning + @copywriting
├── Floor 5: Design       → @ui-ux-pro-max + @frontend-design + @tailwind-patterns
├── Floor 4: Frontend     → @react-best-practices + @react-patterns + @nextjs-best-practices
├── Floor 3: Backenfid      → @senior-fullstack + @backend-dev-guidelines + @api-patterns
├── Floor 2: Data         → @database-design + @postgres-best-practices + @sql-pro
├── Floor 1: Security     → @api-security-best-practices + @backend-security-coder + @frontend-security-coder
└── Floor 0: Infra        → @docker-expert + @deployment-procedures + @observability-engineer
```
You do not need every floor for every task. But you MUST identify which floors are touched and staff them all.
### Tandem Invocation — Real Syntax Examples
Invoke multiple skills in a single prompt, explicitly:
```
"Use @ui-ux-pro-max and @react-patterns together to build the hero section.
Also apply @tailwind-patterns for all styling and @seo-audit for meta structure."
```
```
"Invoke @senior-fullstack alongside @backend-dev-guidelines and @api-patterns
to design and implement the authentication module, with @api-security-best-practices
and @auth-implementation-patterns running in parallel for every decision."
```
```
"Run @test-driven-development, @e2e-testing-patterns, and @browser-automation
in tandem to produce unit, integration, and E2E tests for the checkout flow."
```
```
"Use @brainstorming and @concise-planning together to plan the sprint,
then use @product-manager-toolkit to produce the PRD."
```

## PHASE 0 — PRE-BOOT & SKILL STACK DECLARATION {#phase-0}
> **Trigger:** ALWAYS. The very first thing in every session, before any other action.
### 0.1 — Read the Brain Directory First
```bash
cat .gemini/antigravity/brain/architecture.md 2>/dev/null
cat .gemini/antigravity/brain/decisions.md 2>/dev/null
cat .gemini/antigravity/brain/stack.md 2>/dev/null
cat .gemini/antigravity/brain/skill-tandems.md 2>/dev/null
cat .gemini/antigravity/brain/conventions.md 2>/dev/null
```
If brain files exist → load ALL prior decisions and do not contradict them unless explicitly told to.
### 0.2 — Verify Skill Installation
```bash
# Check universal path first
test -d ~/.agent/skills && echo "✅ Skills ready at ~/.agent/skills"
# If not found, install immediately:
npx antigravity-awesome-skills
# Tool-specific fallbacks:
# npx antigravity-awesome-skills --claude   → .claude/skills/
# npx antigravity-awesome-skills --gemini   → .gemini/skills/
# npx antigravity-awesome-skills --cursor   → .cursor/skills/
# npx antigravity-awesome-skills --codex    → .codex/skills/
# If 404 error:
# npx github:sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills
```
### 0.3 — Mandatory Skill Stack Declaration
Output this block BEFORE any work begins. It is non-negotiable:
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```
### 0.4 — Establish Operating Context
Before writing anything, answer these internally:
```
- What is the business goal? (Not just the technical ask)
- Which floors of the project stack does this session touch?
- What constraints exist? (Budget, timeline, API limits, hosting)
- Who is the end user? (B2B / B2C / Developer / Non-technical)
- What integrations are required?
```
---
## PHASE 1 — PROJECT DISCOVERY & INTELLIGENCE GATHERING {#phase-1}
> **Trigger:** New project, new major feature, or first session on an unfamiliar codebase.
### 1.1 — Codebase Scan
```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.py" \) | head -80
cat package.json 2>/dev/null
cat requirements.txt 2>/dev/null
cat .env.example 2>/dev/null
ls -la
```
### 1.2 — Planning Tandem (Always These Three Together)
```
Use @brainstorming and @concise-planning together to analyze the project goal
and produce a prioritized, structured development plan.
Simultaneously use @product-manager-toolkit to define acceptance criteria
and RICE-score the feature priorities.
```
These three always run together. `@brainstorming` generates ideas → `@concise-planning` structures them → `@product-manager-toolkit` turns them into a shippable spec.
### 1.3 — Business Context Alignment
Resolve all of these before writing a single line of code:
- What is the core user journey from landing to conversion?
- What does "done" look like for this milestone?
- What are the hard constraints? (deadline, spend cap, team size)
- What existing systems must this connect to?
### 1.4 — Preliminary Risk Scan (Dual-Skill)
```
Use @vulnerability-scanner and @api-security-best-practices together
to perform a preliminary dual-layer risk scan on the project type
and any third-party integrations involved.
```
---
## PHASE 2 — ARCHITECTURE & SYSTEM DESIGN {#phase-2}
> **Trigger:** New project, major refactor, or any feature touching more than 3 files.
### 2.1 — Architecture Triple Invocation
```
Use @senior-architect, @architecture-patterns, and @architecture-decision-records together:
- @senior-architect: owns high-level system design, scaling strategy, component boundaries
- @architecture-patterns: selects the right pattern (Clean Architecture, DDD, Hexagonal, Microservices)
- @architecture-decision-records: produces a formal, dated ADR for every major decision
All three run in tandem — the architect's decisions feed directly into the pattern selection,
which feeds directly into the ADR document.
```
### 2.2 — Stack Selection Criteria (Non-Negotiable)
| Criterion | Minimum Standard |
|---|---|
| Scalability | Handles 10x current load without architecture change |
| Maintainability | Any developer understands the codebase in <30 min |
| Cost | Monthly infra cost documented before first commit |
| Security | Auth, RBAC, and data isolation designed at layer 0 |
| Developer Experience | Hot reload, strict typing, linting active from day 1 |
### 2.3 — API Contract Design (Tandem)
```
Use @senior-fullstack, @api-patterns, and @typescript-expert together.
@api-patterns selects the API style (REST vs GraphQL vs tRPC).
@senior-fullstack designs the contract shape and data flow.
@typescript-expert defines strict TypeScript types and interfaces.
If Python: swap @typescript-expert for @python-patterns or @fastapi-pro.
```
### 2.4 — Database Schema Design
```
Use @database-design and @postgres-best-practices together for all schema work.
@database-design: normalization, relationships, ORM selection, indexing strategy.
@postgres-best-practices: Postgres-specific optimization, query patterns, RLS policies.
For Supabase projects: also invoke @supabase (if available) for native Supabase patterns.
```
### 2.5 — Write Architecture to Brain
After this phase, IMMEDIATELY write all decisions:
```bash
mkdir -p .gemini/antigravity/brain/
# Write: architecture summary, stack decisions, ADRs, API contracts to brain files
```
---
## PHASE 3 — WEB DESIGN & UI/UX EXECUTION {#phase-3}
> **Trigger:** Any frontend work — landing pages, dashboards, SaaS UIs, client websites.
### 3.1 — The Designer + Developer Core Duo (MANDATORY PAIRING)
> This is the most fundamental tandem in all frontend work. These two skills are NEVER separated.
```
Use @ui-ux-pro-max and @react-patterns together for ALL frontend work.
This pairing is non-negotiable. One without the other produces incomplete output.
@ui-ux-pro-max owns:
 - Design system (tokens: color, spacing, typography, radius, shadow)
 - Visual hierarchy and layout rhythm
 - Component visual states (default, hover, active, disabled, error)
 - Mobile-first responsive breakpoints
 - Accessibility (contrast ratios, ARIA, focus management)
@react-patterns owns:
 - Component architecture and file structure
 - Hook design and state management
 - Performance (memoization, lazy loading, code splitting)
 - Composability and reusability patterns
```
### 3.2 — Extended Frontend Stack for Full Pages
For any complete page (not just a component), extend the core duo into a full stack:
```
Use @ui-ux-pro-max + @frontend-design + @react-patterns + @react-best-practices
   + @tailwind-patterns + @nextjs-best-practices together.
Role breakdown:
- @ui-ux-pro-max:          Design system, tokens, visual language
- @frontend-design:        Aesthetics, layout composition, colour usage
- @react-patterns:         Component structure and React best practices
- @react-best-practices:   Performance optimization and React 19+ patterns
- @tailwind-patterns:      Utility-first CSS with Tailwind v4
- @nextjs-best-practices:  App Router, RSC, Server Actions, route handlers
```
### 3.3 — Conversion & Marketing Pages (Full 6-Skill Stack)
Landing pages, pricing pages, and any conversion-critical surface require all six:
```
Use @ui-ux-pro-max + @frontend-design + @react-patterns + @tailwind-patterns
   + @copywriting + @seo-audit + @form-cro together.
- @copywriting:  All user-facing text — headlines, CTAs, microcopy, value props
- @seo-audit:    Meta structure, semantic HTML, structured data, page titles
- @form-cro:     Form design optimized for conversion and reduced friction
```
### 3.4 — Immersive / Animated Design
For scroll experiences, 3D elements, or interactive portfolios:
```
Use @ui-ux-pro-max + @scroll-experience + @3d-web-experience + @react-patterns together.
- @scroll-experience:    Scroll-driven animations and parallax patterns
- @3d-web-experience:    Three.js and React Three Fiber integration
```
### 3.5 — Mobile Design
```
Use @ui-ux-pro-max + @mobile-design + @react-patterns together for all mobile-first work.
@mobile-design: Touch targets, gesture handling, viewport scaling, iOS/Android quirks.
```
### 3.6 — Design Tokens (Mandatory Before Any Styled Component)
Before writing a single styled component, establish:
```typescript
// tokens.ts — define FIRST, use everywhere
const tokens = {
 colors: { primary, secondary, accent, surface, error, success },
 spacing: { xs: 4, sm: 8, md: 16, lg: 24, xl: 32, xxl: 48 },
 typography: { fontFamily, fontSizes, fontWeights, lineHeights },
 radii: { sm: 4, md: 8, lg: 16, full: 9999 },
 shadows: { sm, md, lg, xl }
}
```
### 3.7 — Accessibility Standards (Non-Negotiable)
Every interactive element MUST have:
- `aria-label` or visible label text
- Keyboard navigability (`tabIndex`, `focus-visible` styles)
- Color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 (WCAG AA minimum)
- Screen reader compatible semantic markup
### 3.8 — Responsive Breakpoints (Test All Before Marking Done)
- `sm` 640px — mobile
- `md` 768px — tablet
- `lg` 1024px — laptop
- `xl` 1280px — desktop
- `2xl` 1536px — wide monitor
---
## PHASE 4 — SENIOR CODE DEVELOPMENT {#phase-4}
> **Trigger:** Anytime code is being written — features, fixes, refactors, automation, scripts.
### 4.1 — Pre-Code Mandatory Checklist
Before writing ANY code, confirm all are true:
- [ ] Architecture decisions are clear and in brain files
- [ ] Types/interfaces are defined before implementation (TypeScript) or type hints written (Python)
- [ ] The function/component has a single, clear responsibility
- [ ] Edge cases are identified and will be handled explicitly
- [ ] The active skill stack covers every discipline this code touches
- [ ] The code can be tested in isolation
### 4.2 — Full-Stack Feature Development — The 7-Layer Stack
When building a complete feature end-to-end, all seven layers must be staffed:
```
Layer 1 — Planning:
 Use @brainstorming + @concise-planning to spec the feature before touching code.
Layer 2 — Design:
 Use @ui-ux-pro-max + @frontend-design + @react-patterns for all UI surfaces.
Layer 3 — Frontend:
 Use @react-best-practices + @tailwind-patterns + @nextjs-best-practices.
Layer 4 — Backend:
 Use @senior-fullstack + @backend-dev-guidelines + @api-patterns.
Layer 5 — Data:
 Use @database-design + @postgres-best-practices.
Layer 6 — Security:
 Use @api-security-best-practices + @backend-security-coder + @frontend-security-coder.
 (Security is ALWAYS active — it does not get deactivated for "quick" features.)
Layer 7 — Testing:
 Use @test-driven-development + @e2e-testing-patterns.
```
### 4.3 — Language & Framework Tandems
**TypeScript / React / Next.js:**
```
Use @typescript-expert + @react-best-practices + @react-patterns
   + @nextjs-best-practices + @nextjs-app-router-patterns together.
```
**Python / FastAPI:**
```
Use @python-pro + @python-patterns + @fastapi-pro
   + @async-python-patterns + @python-testing-patterns together.
```
**Node.js API:**
```
Use @senior-fullstack + @backend-dev-guidelines + @typescript-expert
   + @nodejs-best-practices + @api-security-best-practices together.
```
**AI Agent / LLM System:**
```
Use @ai-agents-architect + @prompt-engineering + @rag-engineer
   + @langgraph + @llm-app-patterns + @context-window-management together.
All six are required for any non-trivial AI system.
```
**N8N / Make / Automation Workflow:**
```
Use @workflow-automation (if available) + @api-patterns
   + @api-security-best-practices + @systematic-debugging together.
```
**Game Development (Unity/Unreal):**
```
Use @unity-developer + @game-design + @3d-games together for 3D.
Use @unity-developer + @game-design + @2d-games together for 2D.
Also invoke @algorithmic-art for procedural asset generation.
```
### 4.4 — Code Quality Standards (Hard Rules)
| Standard | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Function length | Maximum 40 lines per function |
| Cyclomatic complexity | Maximum 10 |
| Naming | Self-documenting — no single-letter variables except loop iterators |
| Comments | Only explain "why", never "what" — the code explains what |
| Error handling | Every async function has try/catch or an error boundary |
| Logging | Structured logs with context — no raw `console.log` in production |
| Secrets | ALL keys in `.env` — never hardcoded, never committed, never logged |
### 4.5 — API Integration Standards
```
Use @api-security-best-practices + @auth-implementation-patterns together
for every external API integration.
```
- API keys: `.env` always — if it's hardcoded, it's wrong
- Webhook payloads: validate signature before processing
- External calls: retry with exponential backoff
- Rate limits: respect provider limits, implement client-side throttling
### 4.6 — Stripe / Payments
```
Use @stripe-integration + @api-security-best-practices + @pci-compliance together.
No payment integration is complete without all three.
```
### 4.7 — Communications (Twilio, SMS, Voice)
```
Use @twilio-communications + @api-security-best-practices together.
```
---
## PHASE 5 — SENIOR CODE ANALYSIS & REVIEW {#phase-5}
> **Trigger:** Code review, PR review, debugging session, refactoring, or taking over an existing codebase.
### 5.1 — Full Code Audit — Mandatory 5-Skill Tandem
```
Use @senior-architect + @lint-and-validate + @vulnerability-scanner
   + @code-review-checklist + @systematic-debugging together.
Each skill produces its own report. Reports are then merged:
- @senior-architect:        Architectural quality, technical debt, scaling risks
- @lint-and-validate:       Static analysis, code style, type errors
- @vulnerability-scanner:   OWASP Top 10, dependency CVEs, injection risks
- @code-review-checklist:   PR-level checklist, logic errors, missed edge cases
- @systematic-debugging:    Root cause analysis for any identified failures
```
### 5.2 — Performance Analysis
```
Use @performance-engineer + @react-best-practices together to identify:
```
- N+1 database queries
- Blocking main thread operations
- Unnecessary re-renders (React DevTools Profiler)
- Unoptimized bundle size (`next build && next analyze`)
- Missing image optimization
**Lighthouse targets:** ≥ 90 for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO
### 5.3 — Technical Debt Classification
Label all findings before handing off:
| Label | Definition | Required Action |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Security vulnerability or data loss risk | Block merge — fix first |
| 🟠 HIGH | Broken user flow or major performance issue | Fix in current sprint |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | Code smell, missing test, or anti-pattern | Fix in next sprint |
| 🟢 LOW | Style inconsistency or minor refactor opportunity | Backlog |
### 5.4 — Dependency Audit
```bash
npm audit --audit-level=high
# Python:
pip-audit
```
`high` or `critical` severity = **merge blocked until resolved**.
---
## PHASE 6 — SECURITY HARDENING {#phase-6}
> **Trigger:** Before ANY production deployment. After any auth change. Weekly on all live products.
### 6.1 — The Security Trio (Always All Three, Never Fewer)
```
Use @api-security-best-practices + @backend-security-coder + @frontend-security-coder together.
These three are NEVER invoked individually for production security work.
They always run as a trio — API layer, server layer, and client layer simultaneously.
For deep audits, extend to the full Security Engineer stack:
Use @ethical-hacking-methodology + @top-web-vulnerabilities + @security-auditor
   + @vulnerability-scanner + @api-security-best-practices together.
```
### 6.2 — Authentication & Authorization Rules
```
Use @auth-implementation-patterns for all auth implementation.
```
- Auth is NEVER built from scratch — use Supabase Auth, NextAuth, Clerk, or Auth0
- Every route has explicit RBAC defined before any code is written
- JWT tokens: 15-minute access, 7-day refresh, never localStorage
- All sensitive operations require explicit re-authentication
### 6.3 — Data Protection
- PII is never logged, anywhere, ever
- PII fields are encrypted at rest
- All transmission uses HTTPS (TLS 1.3 minimum)
- File uploads: validate type AND magic bytes (not just file extension)
- ALL SQL queries: parameterized statements only — no string interpolation
### 6.4 — Mandatory Security Headers
```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```
### 6.5 — Payments Security
```
Use @pci-compliance + @stripe-integration + @api-security-best-practices together.
Never handle raw card data — always use Stripe Elements or Stripe Checkout.
```
---
## PHASE 7 — INFRASTRUCTURE & DEPLOYMENT {#phase-7}
> **Trigger:** Before any deployment — staging or production.
### 7.1 — Deployment Tandem
```
Use @deployment-procedures + @docker-expert + @observability-engineer together
for all deployments.
- @deployment-procedures: safe rollout strategy, canary/blue-green, rollback plan
- @docker-expert:         container build optimization, multi-stage Dockerfiles, compose
- @observability-engineer: monitoring setup, alerting thresholds, health checks
For AWS: add @aws-serverless as a fourth skill.
For K8s: add @kubernetes-architect as a fourth skill.
For IaC: add @terraform-specialist as a fifth skill.
```
### 7.2 — Environment Management
Every project runs three environments with no exceptions:
| Environment | Purpose | Auto-Deploy | Approval Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `development` | Local dev, experiments | No | No |
| `staging` | Pre-prod testing, client demos | Yes (on PR) | No |
| `production` | Live user traffic | No | Yes — manual only |
### 7.3 — Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All environment variables set in deployment platform (NOT in `.env` file committed to git)
- [ ] Database migrations are backwards-compatible (can roll back without data loss)
- [ ] Health check endpoint active and returns 200 (`/api/health`)
- [ ] Error tracking configured (Sentry or equivalent)
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented AND tested
- [ ] Rate limiting active on all public-facing endpoints
- [ ] Security headers verified
### 7.4 — CI/CD Pipeline — Required Order
1. `lint` — fail fast on style and formatting
2. `type-check` — TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` or mypy
3. `test` — unit + integration
4. `build` — production build must succeed
5. `security-scan` — `npm audit --audit-level=high`
6. `deploy` — only on `main` or tagged release branch, after human approval for production
---
## PHASE 8 — TESTING & QA {#phase-8}
> **Trigger:** After every feature. Before every PR. Before every deployment.
### 8.1 — The QA Skill Stack (All Five Active Together)
```
Use @test-driven-development + @systematic-debugging + @browser-automation
   + @e2e-testing-patterns + @test-fixing together.
Role breakdown:
- @test-driven-development:  Red/green/refactor cycle — write tests first
- @systematic-debugging:     Root cause analysis when tests fail
- @browser-automation:       Playwright-based E2E and browser automation
- @e2e-testing-patterns:     Reliable, non-flaky E2E test suite design
- @test-fixing:              Systematic approach to fixing broken tests after refactors
```
### 8.2 — Test Coverage Requirements
| Layer | Minimum Coverage | Test Type |
|---|---|---|
| Pure utility functions | 100% | Unit |
| API routes / handlers | 90% | Integration |
| Critical UI components | 80% | Component |
| Critical user journeys | 100% | E2E |
### 8.3 — Non-Negotiable E2E Tests (Must Exist Before Production)
- User registration and email verification
- Login, logout, session expiry
- Core conversion action (signup CTA, purchase, booking, form submission)
- Payment flow (if applicable — full Stripe test mode run)
- Data submission and retrieval round-trip
- Error states (network failure, validation errors, 404, 500)
- Empty states (new user, no data, no results)
### 8.4 — Performance Benchmarks
```bash
npx lhci autorun
# Load test:
npx autocannon -c 100 -d 30 https://staging.yourapp.com/api/health
```
---
## PHASE 9 — DOCUMENTATION & HANDOFF {#phase-9}
> **Trigger:** After every major feature. At project completion. Before any handoff.
### 9.1 — Documentation Tandem
```
Use @documentation-templates + @changelog-automation together.
@documentation-templates: standardized docs structure and handoff format.
@changelog-automation: keep release notes consistent and up to date automatically.
```
### 9.2 — Mandatory Documentation Set
| Document | Location | Owner Skill | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Root | `@documentation-templates` | Setup, run, deploy, env vars |

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS {#emergency}
### Production Is Down
```
1. DO NOT make changes without a documented rollback plan.
2. Use @observability-engineer + @systematic-debugging + @incident-responder together
  to diagnose the failure and coordinate response.
3. Check logs FIRST — never guess the cause.
4. Roll back to last known good deployment.
5. Use @postmortem-writing to write a blameless post-mortem within 24 hours.
```
### Security Breach Suspected
```
1. IMMEDIATELY revoke all active API keys, sessions, and tokens.
2. Use @vulnerability-scanner + @api-security-best-practices
  + @ethical-hacking-methodology together to assess the full attack surface.
3. Do not discuss the breach publicly until investigation is complete.
4. Notify affected users within 72 hours (GDPR/compliance requirement).
5. Use @security-auditor to document findings and remediation.
```
### Runaway API Costs (Google AI Studio / Gemini)
```
1. Immediately add hard spend cap in Google Cloud Console.
2. Use @api-security-best-practices + @observability-engineer together
  to identify the source of runaway calls and add rate limiting.
3. Enable billing alerts at 50%, 80%, and 100% of budget threshold.
4. Review all public endpoints for missing authentication.
```
### Critical Bug in Production
```
Use @systematic-debugging + @incident-responder together for active debugging.
Use @test-driven-development to write a regression test before deploying the fix.
Never deploy a fix without a test that catches it.
```

```
> `skill-tandems.md` is critical. Every time a skill combination works exceptionally well for this specific project, log it here so every future agent session can build on it without rediscovering it.
### Brain Read Protocol (Every Session Start)
```bash
# Run this before anything else in every session
for f in architecture stack decisions conventions integrations skill-tandems; do
 echo "=== $f ===" && cat ".gemini/antigravity/brain/$f.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "(not yet written)"
done
```
### Brain Write Protocol (Every Session End and After Major Decisions)
Write to brain after:
- Every architectural decision (with rationale and date)
- Every new convention established
- Every new external integration added
- Every successful new skill tandem discovered
- Every significant bug found AND its root cause
- Every session end (what was accomplished, what is next)
---
## ✅ SESSION COMPLETION CHECKLIST {#checklist}
Before ending ANY work session, every item must be checked:
**Code Quality**
- [ ] Lint and type checks pass (`npm run lint && tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] No secrets or API keys anywhere in committed code
- [ ] All new code has corresponding tests
- [ ] No `console.log` statements in production paths
**Documentation**
- [ ] Brain files updated with session summary and any new decisions
- [ ] `brain/skill-tandems.md` updated with effective skill combinations used today
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with what changed
- [ ] Outstanding TODOs have GitHub issue numbers assigned
**Deployment (if applicable)**
- [ ] Staging deployment verified and tested
- [ ] Security headers confirmed active
- [ ] Monitoring alerts confirmed active
- [ ] Rollback procedure confirmed available
**Handoff**
- [ ] Next session's starting point is documented in `brain/session-log.md`
- [ ] Any blockers or open questions are written down explicitly

Website Copy Prompt:

Here is your complete master prompt. It's engineered as a two-stage system — the Extractor Prompt you feed into Gemini with your screenshot/video, and the structured output format it produces, which you paste directly into Google Antigravity or Claude Code.
🧠 The Master Website Aesthetic Extractor Prompt
Copy everything below the divider and paste it into Gemini with your screenshot or screen recording attached:
text
You are an expert UI/UX Design Analyst and Senior Frontend Engineer.
Your task is to perform a **complete aesthetic forensic analysis** of the attached website screenshot or video.
Your goal: Produce a **structured, copy-paste-ready Design Implementation Sheet** — a single output document so precise and complete that any developer (or AI coding agent like Google Antigravity, Claude Code, or GPT-4o) can rebuild this website's exact visual style from scratch, without ever seeing the original.
---
## ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS
Examine the attached image or video frame-by-frame and extract ALL of the following. Be precise. Use exact hex codes, exact pixel values, exact font names, exact CSS values wherever possible. Where you cannot determine the exact value, give the closest professional estimate and flag it with `[ESTIMATED]`.
Do NOT describe what the website is about. ONLY extract the visual and design system.

--shadow-glow-accent: 0 0 24px rgba(___,___,___,0.___);
SECTION 7 — VISUAL EFFECTS & TEXTURE
Identify and describe:
Glassmorphism: backdrop-filter blur levels, background opacity
Gradients: type (linear/radial/conic), direction, exact color stops
Noise/grain texture: yes/no, intensity
Background patterns: grid lines, dots, noise, geometric shapes
Image overlays or tints
Frosted glass panels
Mesh gradients or aurora effects
Write the CSS for each:
css
/* Example */
--glass-bg: rgba(255,255,255,0.08);
--glass-blur: blur(12px);
--glass-border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.12);
--gradient-hero: linear-gradient(135deg, #______ 0%, #______ 100%);
--gradient-cta: linear-gradient(90deg, #______ 0%, #______ 100%);
SECTION 8 — COMPONENT BREAKDOWN
For each UI component visible, write a precise description AND the CSS spec:
Buttons
Primary CTA button: background, text color, border, border-radius, padding, font-weight, hover state, shadow, any gradient or glow
Secondary button: same fields
Ghost/outline button: same fields
Navigation / Header
Background style (transparent, frosted, solid, sticky behavior)
Logo area
Nav link style (font, size, weight, color, hover state)
Active state style
CTA in nav
Cards / Panels
Background, border, border-radius, padding, shadow
Hover effect
Any inner layout pattern
Input Fields / Forms
Background, border, border-radius, font, placeholder color, focus ring color
Tags / Badges / Pills
Background, text color, border-radius, font size, padding
Section Dividers / Separators
Style used (line, gradient fade, spacing only, decorative shape)
SECTION 9 — ANIMATION & MOTION LANGUAGE
Identify:
Hover animations (scale, color shift, glow, underline draw, lift)
Scroll-triggered animations (fade in, slide up, stagger)
Page transition style
Loading/skeleton states if visible
Cursor effects if any
Micro-interaction patterns (button press, toggle)
Write CSS transition specs:
css
--transition-fast: 150ms ease;
--transition-base: 250ms ease;
--transition-slow: 400ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
--transition-spring: 500ms cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);
SECTION 10 — ICONOGRAPHY & IMAGERY STYLE
Icon style: line icons, filled, duotone, 3D, custom illustrated, emoji-based
Icon size scale
Image treatment: photos, illustrations, 3D renders, AI-generated
Image border-radius, overlay style, aspect ratios used
Any consistent image filter or treatment (e.g. desaturated, duotone tint, warm filter)
SECTION 11 — SECTION LAYOUT PATTERNS
Describe the layout pattern of each major section visible:
Hero: layout type, alignment, background treatment, CTA placement
Feature section: grid or list, icon/image placement
Testimonials: card style, avatar treatment
Footer: column count, link style, background
SECTION 12 — IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT
This is the most critical section. Write a single, self-contained, copy-paste prompt that someone can paste directly into Google Antigravity, Claude Code, or any AI coding agent to build a new website that matches the extracted style EXACTLY.
This prompt must:
Be written in imperative, direct language ("Build a...", "Use...", "Apply...")
Include ALL CSS variables from Sections 2–9 in a single :root block
Specify the exact font imports (Google Fonts @import link or equivalent)
Describe the visual language in 2–3 sentences so the AI understands the vibe
Instruct the AI to build with HTML + CSS + vanilla JS OR React + Tailwind (specify whichever matches the original)
Include exact component specs for: hero, navbar, cards, buttons, footer
Include animation instructions
End with: "Do not deviate from the design system above. Every element must use the defined CSS variables. The final output must visually match the reference aesthetic."
OUTPUT RULES:
Be EXHAUSTIVE. Do not summarize or skip details.
Use technical language. This output is for developers and AI agents.
Every color must be a hex code. No "dark blue" or "warm gray."
Every size must be a number. No "small" or "large."
If something is not visible or unclear, write: [NOT VISIBLE — RECOMMEND: ______] and suggest a matching value.
Do NOT include explanations of what the website does. Only design data.
Keep each section tight and structured. Use code blocks for all CSS.
Total output should be comprehensive but NOT redundant. Say each thing once, precisely.

## How to Use This in Your Workflow
Here's the exact workflow to show in your video:[1][2]
1. **Attach the screenshot or screen recording** of any website to Gemini 3 in Google AI Studio (or the Antigravity chat), then paste the entire prompt above
2. **Gemini runs the analysis** and produces the full Design Implementation Sheet
3. **Copy Section 12 (The Implementation Prompt)** — this is your golden paste-in block
4. **Open Google Antigravity**, start a new project, and paste Section 12 directly as your first message
5. **Follow up** with Section 2–9's CSS variables block to ensure Antigravity locks in the exact tokens
## Pro Tips for Your Video
- Google Antigravity's agent can accept the full CSS `:root` block as a follow-up message after the initial build, telling it to *"replace all hardcoded colors and values with these CSS variables"*[3]
- For **output length management**, if Gemini starts hitting its response limit, simply reply: `"Continue from SECTION ___"` — the modular structure of this prompt makes this seamless
- You can also split the analysis into two Gemini calls: Call 1 extracts Sections 1–7 (design tokens), Call 2 extracts Sections 8–12 (components + implementation prompt)[4]
- This prompt works with **Gemini 3, Claude 3.7, GPT-4o, and Grok 3** — all support vision and structured output[5]
